# One-liner (card blurb on homepage)
summary: "Corporate America isn’t a level playing field—so play to win with “booster cards”: excellence, brand armor, mentors, and self-compassion."

# One-paragraph abstract (used on the talk page)
abstract: "This talk names the reality: the workplace isn’t fair and 'meritocracy' is a myth. Instead of waiting for perfect conditions, the talk offers four practical 'booster cards.' Including advice on mentorship and personal brand, these moves help underrepresented professionals navigate bias, reclaim agency, and advance with purpose."
