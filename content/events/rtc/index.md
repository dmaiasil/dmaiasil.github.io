  An insightful panel on how to define your own career path in tech by aligning your strengths and interests with meaningful roles, not just trends.

abstract: >-
  Let’s get one thing straight: there’s no “National Developer Registry.”  
  You don’t need a special degree to call yourself a software engineer, data scientist, or data analyst. Companies throw titles around like confetti, and the same name can mean different things depending on where you work. Confusing? Yes. Liberating? Absolutely.

  So, if anyone can be anything in tech, how do you figure out what actually works for you?  
  This session shared a framework for *finding your niche in tech*, encouraging attendees to align personal strengths with purpose and growth.
