summary: >-
  Corporate America isn't a level playing fieldâ€”so play to win with "booster cards": excellence, brand armor, mentors, and self-compassion.

abstract: >-
  This talk, "Beating the Game: Booster Cards to Win Corporate America," starts by naming the reality: the workplace isn't fair and "meritocracy" is often a myth. Instead of waiting for perfect conditions, the talk offers four practical "booster cards." Excellence: show up, be present, and leverage diversity of thought; Cup Armor: protect and manage your professional image and brand, especially under bias; Mentor: find safe, strategic allies outside your immediate team; and Be Gentle to Yourself: normalize mistakes and replace reflexive apologies with constructive acknowledgments (e.g., "Thanks for pointing that out"). Together, these moves help underrepresented professionals navigate bias, reclaim agency, and advance with purpose.
