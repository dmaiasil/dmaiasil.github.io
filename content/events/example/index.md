  "Beating the Game: Booster Cards to Win Corporate America" is an honest talk: the workplace isn't fair
  and "meritocracy" is often a myth. Instead of waiting for perfect conditions, the talk offers practical advice
  to navigate the work environment and play to win. These moves help underrepresented professionals navigate bias,
  reclaim agency, and advance with purpose.
