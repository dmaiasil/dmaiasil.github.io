# One-liner (card blurb on homepage)
summary: "Corporate America isn’t a level playing field—so play to win with “booster cards”: excellence, brand armor, mentors, and self-compassion."

# One-paragraph abstract (used on the talk page)
abstract: "This talk, 'Beating the Game: Booster Cards to Win Corporate America,' starts by naming the reality: the workplace isn’t fair and 'meritocracy' is often a myth. Instead of waiting for perfect conditions, the talk offers four practical 'booster cards.' Excellence: show up, be present, and leverage diversity of thought; Cup Armor: protect and manage your professional image and brand, especially under bias; Mentor: find safe, strategic allies outside your immediate team; and Be Gentle to Yourself: normalize mistakes and replace reflexive apologies with constructive acknowledgments (e.g., 'Thanks for pointing that out'). Together, these moves help underrepresented professionals navigate bias, reclaim agency, and advance with purpose."
