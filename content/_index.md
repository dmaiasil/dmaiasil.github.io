        My mission is to **build AI systems that are ethical, explainable, and impactful**, transforming how organizations use data to make better, more responsible decisions.  

        I work at the intersection of **AI innovation, ethics, and real-world application**, leading projects that make machine learning both scalable and sustainable.  

        As an **educator and international speaker**, I‚Äôm passionate about **democratizing technology** through inclusion and knowledge-sharing. I founded **Vem ser Dev** to empower Portuguese-speaking learners in Python and data science.

        Through my talks and collaborations, I aim to **bridge the gap between complex AI systems and human understanding**, inspiring teams and audiences to use data for good.  

        üì© *Open to collaboration, speaking engagements, and initiatives that drive ethical innovation.*  

        **So, what can data do for you?**
