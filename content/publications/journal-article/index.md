abstract: >-
  The higher frequency and intensity of sustained heat events have increased the demand for cooling energy across the globe. Current estimates of summertime energy demand are primarily based on Cooling Degree Days (CDD), representing the number of degrees a day's average temperature exceeds a predetermined comfort zone temperature. Through a comprehensive analysis of historical energy demand data across the USA, we show that the commonly used CDD estimates fall significantly short (±25%) of capturing regional thermal comfort levels. Moreover, given the increasingly compelling evidence that air temperature alone is not sufficient for characterizing human thermal comfort, we extend the widely used CDD calculation to heat index, which accounts for both air temperature and humidity. Our results indicate significant misestimation of regional thermal comfort when humidity is ignored. These findings have important implications for the security, sustainability, and resilience of the power grid under climate change.
