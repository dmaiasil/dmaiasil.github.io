abstract: >-
  The environmental costs of adopting new technologies and habits are often recognized too late, typically when changing the adopted technologies and behavioral norms is difficult. A similar story may unfold if society continues to blindly transition to an unregulated and environmentally unaudited digital world, a transition path that has been facilitated by the fourth industrial revolution and is now accelerated by the global COVID-19 crisis. The newly developed digital lifestyle has major environmental benefits, including the reduction of travel-related COâ‚‚ emissions. Yet, increased Internet use has some hidden environmental impacts that must be uncovered to make the transition to a low-carbon and green economy successful.
